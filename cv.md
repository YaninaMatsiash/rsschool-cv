## Briefly About Myself:
My working path was very diverse and eventful. It made me inquisitive, disciplined, and loving constant learning.
At first, I worked as a graphic artist in a studio that specialized in making leather-bound books. There I very quickly mastered such programs as CorelDRAW, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
Later, I felt I wanted to know more about design and quickly found a job in a print shop. There I gained extensive experience and knowledge in the field of advertising and printing and prepress.
But since all this time I was pararallistically studying to become a software engineer, I naturally began to be attracted to web design.
At some point, I felt like I wasn't enough again. So came the understanding that it's time to move on and start learning the profession of Frontend Developer. Since I want not only to create a beautiful picture, but also to understand the further development of sites and applications. I am sure that this is a very exciting way and all my previous experience will be able to help me.
